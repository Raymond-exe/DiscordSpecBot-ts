really though, the intent of this bot is to help users determine if their PC can run a given game on Steam (or on other game markets?) using the various resources linked below.

- [Steam Web API](https://steamwebapi.azurewebsites.net).
- [Farzher's](https://github.com/farzher) [Fuzzysort](https://github.com/farzher/fuzzysort) node package.

- And of course, [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).
