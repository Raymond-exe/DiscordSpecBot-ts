really though, the intent of this bot is to help users determine if their PC can run a given game on Steam (or on other game markets?) using the various resources linked below.

- [Steam Web API](https://steamwebapi.azurewebsites.net).
- [Farzher's](https://github.com/farzher) [Fuzzysort](https://github.com/farzher/fuzzysort) node package.
- Considering using [darthbatman's](https://github.com/darthbatman) unofficial [PC Part Picker API](https://github.com/darthbatman/pcpartpicker), if it works.
- And of course, [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

*Storage of PC specs (and possibly outlying popular games not on the steam market?) will be on a private [Google Firestore NoSQL Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)*

If you have any ideas, feel free to open a new [issue](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/DiscordSpecBot-ts/issues) to suggest it, but colloration through pull requests is of course always welcome :)
